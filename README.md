# UCL Image Understanding Coursework Data

To download files open terminal and browse to the folder you want to store the data using the `cd` command.

Clone the repository by typing: `git clone https://github.com/dgriffiths3/ucl_cegeg075`

Next move into the folder and open jupyter notebook with: 

`cd ucl_cegeg075`
`jupyter notebook`

It is important you run `jupyter notebook` whilst in the `ucl_cege075` directory as otherwise the file paths will not work correctly.

### Coursework Task:

You task is to use the tools discussed in the practicals (as well as the many more available) to extract a specific feature from a single (or group of) image(s). The feature(s) of choice as well as image(s) is up to you. It can be imagery aquired from satellite, aerial or terrestrial methods as well as your choice of spectral bands (i.e. R, G, B, NIR, SWIR etc.). You are encouraged to think outside-the-box and use internet resources such as tutorials to incorporate new methods not discussed within these practicals.
You should assess the accuracies of your proposed solution highlighting it's strengths and weaknesses. The accuracy assessment should be undertaken both on images you designed the solution around as well as new images you have not seen before. You should comment on why you think the solution is performing as it is.

Finally, you need to determine how you could make the solution better. For this you are encouraged to research what methods are available and currently being used to solve similar problems. Whilst you do not need to programme this yourself, you should still demonstrate that you understand how the algorithms work as well as why they are applicable in your scenario.

### Delivery

The coursework will be formed of 2 components. Firstly, a 2000 word research report style write up (i.e. Introduction, Methodology, Results, Discussion, Conclusion). You should pose the segmentation problem as a research problem and carry out the necessary steps to solve it.

Secondly, a file (preferrably .py / .ipynb) containing the source code for your solution. This should be properly annotation and commented. For advice on how to correctly format code for delievery take a look here. The most important aspect here is frequent in-line commenting explaining what your code is doing. This allows us to see that you understand why you have carried out certain command. Finally, if you use functions they should be properly commented showing their input and output arguments as well as a brief description of the function.

### Deadline

Both documents should be uploaded to moodle by 28th March 2018.
